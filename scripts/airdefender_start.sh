# Air Defender: start the detection loop. callbacks.sh runs this when fppd
# starts or loads the plugin (after an install or update).
# fppd waits for it, as root, so the loop is detached into the
# background and run as the fpp user (the dashboard, which runs as fpp,
# shares its files). It runs under a small watchdog that starts it again
# if it ever stops on its own.
