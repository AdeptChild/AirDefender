 *
 * Safety mode closes each enabled moving head's shutter by putting an FPP
 * overlay on its shutter channel: PUT /overlays/range/<ch> {"Value": closed}.
 * fppd writes that value into the channel data on every output frame, over
 * whatever the sequence is doing, and it reaches the fixture however the
 * channel is output (a Kulp's serial DMX port, E1.31/DDP to a Falcon, ...).
 *
 * Clearing deletes the overlay, so the sequence drives the shutter again.
 * It deliberately does not force the shutter open: the show may want it
 * closed at that moment.
 *
 * The signal is never cut. Most fixtures hold their last values when DMX
 * stops, which could leave a beam frozen open and pointing up.
 *
 * Overlays live in fppd's memory and vanish when fppd restarts, so the loop
 * re-applies them every cycle while safety mode is on.
 *
 * Releasing is only ever done for an overlay set during the current run of
 * fppd. Once fppd has restarted, its overlays are already gone, and on FPP
 * 10.0-10.2 a delete for a range fppd doesn't have creates one at 255 instead
 * (fixed in 10.3), which would hold the shutter open over the sequence. So
 * each overlay is recorded with the fppd run it was set in, and channels from
 * an earlier run are forgotten without a delete.
